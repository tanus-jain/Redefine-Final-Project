# Redefine-Final-Project
Before I joined [redefine](https://www.redefine-cs.org/) as a course instructor in 2021, I was a student in the 2020 program. That summer, for my Final Project, I decided to build a polynomial regression model using Pandas and Python to predict future air pollution levels given current data trends.
[The final model can be accessed here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r4GhztXNgO3YZNpKawNAb20xXMDd_1O2?usp=sharing)
