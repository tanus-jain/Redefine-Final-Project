Background: I am planning on using the Environment dataset
(provided: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redefine-cs/redefine-cs.github.io/master/resources/environment.csv). 

For context, this dataset is a collection of climate data from May 1983 to December 2008. 
It provides how levels of different gases and pollution in the atmosphere have fluctuated across the years, along with temperature changes. 
I want to use the data to compare each of the gases and pollutants with the temperature change to figure which gas caused the greatest increase 
in temperature. I hope to create graphs that explore the correlation between different greenhouse gases to the temperature throughout the years. 
From that, I will figure out which gas caused the most temperature change, or has the strongest correlation. My hypothesis is that CO2 will result 
in the strongest correlation.
